This is a Swift SDK to integrate [Keycard](https://github.com/status-im/status-keycard) with iOS13+.

This SDK is a work in progress, please check the Issues to contribute.

To integrate Keycard with Android or Desktop, please refer to [Keycard Java SDK](https://github.com/status-im/status-keycard-java). Keycard also has a [Go SDK](https://github.com/status-im/keycard-go/).
